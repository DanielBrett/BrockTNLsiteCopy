## What

A proof of concept portal for Brock Library information literacy and research skills learning objects. Easily edited and remixable content. Built with Hugo, using the Dot theme. 
If you want to spin this up locally or on your own repo, just copy what's inside the '_site' directory. 
## Features

Remixed the Dot theme to serve eLearning purposes. Essentially serves as a repository of lessons built in markdown. 

* Lightning quick loading
* No databases (phew)
* Vanilla JS filtering in the DOM 
* To add content, simply copy a folder in /content and change the markdown to your liking. You can spin up new lessons in seconds.
